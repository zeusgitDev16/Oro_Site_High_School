### GUIDE IN CREATING THIS USER:
--- 📝 SUMMARRY - so far, we manage to create the admin side, teacher side and the student side so in this document, our goal now is to create the parent side.

---     GOAL - so our goal in the parent side is simple, this user is a read only user who can see and track their student progress especially their grades and final grades like quarterly grades. also we will implement a notificationa and messaging system in this user too so that if they want to communicate with the teachers or admin, they have the ability to send their concerns.

---    this should be simple, core features of this must be:
            - attendance tracking - parents can see their children's attendance
            - progress and assignments -  parents can see their child progress and completion of assignments
            - grades and final grades, parents can see their childrens scores and crucially, their children's final grades like Q1 grades up to Q4, typical deped.

---     PLEASE NOTE:
        - on the making of this user, please scan the OSHS_ARCHITECTURE_and_FLOW.md, to have a grasp of our main flow. 
        - also, please scan the student side so that you will have a better idea on how you can implement their relationship as well as the teacher and admin, this user must have relationship will all user type. but since this user is a read only user, i expect that the feature in this user is less. just the necessary features.
