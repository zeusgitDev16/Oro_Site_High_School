### this is the rules you need to follow while integrating backend to our flutter web app

1. do not create a copy of something that is not done, example of this is earlier i told you to modify the login_screen but what you did is you created a enhance_login_screen which is i do not want to, if you want to enhance a file, enhance it directly instead of creating a copy,

2. do not change existing UI visuality in the process of your implementation of the backend,

3. always add a debuger print statement where we can track certain persistent error because we are now entering the complex part of our system.
