## 🎓 For Thesis Defense

### **Story to Tell:**
```
"Currently, teachers can select files to share, 
but they need a way to organize their students. 

That's where Classrooms come in! 

Teachers will create Classrooms, link their Courses, 
add Students, and then share files directly to 
those Classrooms.

This creates a structured learning environment 
where students can easily access course materials 
organized by their actual class sections."
```

### **Demo Points:**
1. ✅ Show file selection with checkboxes
2. ✅ Show "Share To" button appearing
3. ✅ Show share dialog with classroom placeholder
4. ✅ Explain the upcoming classroom feature
5. ✅ Show how it will integrate with courses

## 📊 Summary

### **What Changed:**
- ✅ Removed radio button options
- ✅ Added classroom placeholder
- ✅ Added "Create Classroom" button

### **What's the Hint:**
- 💡 **Classrooms** are coming!
- 💡 Teachers will organize students into classrooms
- 💡 Courses will be linked to classrooms
