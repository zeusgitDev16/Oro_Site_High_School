THIS DOCUMENT IS THE INSTRUCTION ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE STUDENT SIDE.

### quick summary:
 ---    SO FAR, WE MANAGE TO CREATE THE ADMIN SIDE AND THE TEACER SIDE CONTAINER DIFFERENT ROLES LIKE THE ADMIN, ICT COORDINATOR, ADMIN WITH TEACHER FEATURES SUCH AS THE HYBRID USER, AND THEN THE ADMIN AND TEACHER SIDE RELATIONSHIP, YOU CAN SCAN OUR WHOLE PROJECT TO GAIN MUCH MORE ACCURATE ON WHAT WE ACHIEVED.

 ---    IN THIS IMPLEMENTATION, I WANT YOU TO SCAN OUR ANOTHER DOCUMENT NAMED OSHS_ARCHITECTURE_and_FLOW.md, THAT FILE CONTAINS THE WHOLE FLOW, INSTRUCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE IN MAKING THIS PROJECT, YOU CAN ALSO SEE THERE DETAILED INFO ABOUT THE STUDENT.

 ### GOAL:
 ---    THE REASON I CREATED THIS DOCUMENT IS THAT TO INSTRUCT YOU WHAT WILL BE YOUR GUIDE IN MAKING THE STUDENT SIDE, SO I WANT YOU TO MAKE IT SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND REUSE ANY FILE WE CAN REUSE SINCE WE SEPARATED THE UI AND INTERACTIVITY OF IT, SO OUR DASHBOARD IN THE TEACHER AND ADMIN AS WELL AS THE PROFILE IN THE TEACHER AND ADMIN SHOULD BE ALSO IMPLEMENTED WITH THIS NEW STUDENT SIDE THAT WE WILL CREATE, LIKE THE SIDEBARS, AND THE TWO TIER SIDEBARS THAT IS PRESENT IN THE ADMIN AS WELL AS THE TEACHER SHOULD ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE STUDENT, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, THIS NEW DASHBOARD AND PROFILE SHOULD BE INTENDED FOR STUDENTS. 

 ### FLOW:
 ---     THE STUDENTS MUST HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH TEACHERS LIKE, WHEN THE TEACHER ADDS SOMETHING OR CREATED SOMETHING BASED ON OUR CURRENT TEACHER FEATURES, THE STUDENTS CAN ACCESS THAT AND FOR MORE CLARIFICATION, THIS IS DEPED AND SCHOOL IN THE PHILIPPINES WHICH IS THE ORO SITE HIGH SCHOOL, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A KNOWLEGDE ABOUT THE FLOW OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES THAT IS WHY I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS PROPERLY. SCAN THE OSHS_ARCHITECTURE_and_FLOW.md, AS IT IS ALSO OUR MAIN FLOW.

 ### STUCTURE:

 ---    OUR STRUCTURE IN CREATING THIS STUDENT SIDE IS SIMPLE, JUST COPY THE UI DESIGN THAT IS PRESENT IN THE ADMIN AND IN THE TEACHER SIDE BUT OF COURSE MAKE IT FOR STUDENT SIDE. 
 
 ### CRUCIAL:

 ---    THE PRIORITY OF THIS MUST BE HIGH, IN CREATING THIS STUDENT SIDE, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE IMPLEMENTING A FEATURE THAT WILL BE RELATED TO THE FEATURES OF THE TEACHER AS WELL AS THE ADMIN, THEY SHOULD ALL BE RELATED.
