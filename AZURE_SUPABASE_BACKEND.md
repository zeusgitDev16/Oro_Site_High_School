### this document describes my progress:

i manage to create a azure portal account

in this account i created an app registry named Oro Site High School ELMS
i setup the necessary setups and then i linked my app registry to supabase azure auth,

i created users:

admin
dmain: admin@aezycreativegmail.onmicrosoft.com
Password: OroSystem123#2025

ICT_Coordinator
dmain: ICT_Coordinator@aezycreativegmail.onmicrosoft.com
Password: OroSystem123#2025

Teacher
dmain: Teacher@aezycreativegmail.onmicrosoft.com
Password: OroSystem123#2025

Student
dmain student@aezycreativegmail.onmicrosoft.com
Password: OroSystem123#2025

i also have created 28 tables in supabase (you can scan the supabase tables.md and supabase tables part2.md for reference)

now that i have this, i think we should now get back to coding and start filling the backend folder? what do you think?
